  # WARNING
  #
  # 1. Enabling this will set TokenManager's economy as your server's main economy.
  # Your old economy data will most likely RESET, and commands related to Economy
  # such as Essentials' /eco won't function properly if target player is offline.
  #
  # 2. If you're using Essentials Economy, make sure to reset everyone's balance
  # before enabling this option! Otherwise, the old Essentials balance of the players
  # might act as a token balance.
  #
  register-economy: false

  # /token top will be updated every x minutes. Value must be higher than 0!
